//............React.strictMode...................
// React.StrictMode is a special tool in React that helps developers catch potential problems in their code.
//  It doesn't affect the functionality of your appâ€”it just runs extra checks and warnings during development 
//  to make sure everything is following best practices.

//ex:It warns you if you're using old, outdated React functions that might be removed in future versions.
